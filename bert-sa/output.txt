Yum!  ----  Positive 

Serves really good sushi.  ----  Positive 

Not the biggest portions but adequate.  ----  Negative 

Green Tea creme brulee is a must!  ----  Positive 

Don't leave the restaurant without it.  ----  Negative 

No Comparison  ----  Negative 

– I can't say enough about this place.  ----  Positive 

It has great sushi and even better service.  ----  Positive 

The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need.  ----  Positive 

I've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date.  ----  Positive 

Snotty Attitude  ----  Negative 

– We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast.  ----  Negative 

The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint.  ----  Negative 

Good food!  ----  Positive 

– We love breakfast food.  ----  Positive 

This is a great place to get a delicious meal.  ----  Positive 

We never had to wait more than 5 minutes.  ----  Positive 

The staff is pretty friendly.  ----  Positive 

The onion rings are great!  ----  Positive 

They are not greasy or anything.  ----  Negative 

Overrated  ----  Negative 

– I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda.  ----  Negative 

The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.  ----  Negative 

The prices are outrageous, especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments.  ----  Negative 

Nice ambience, but highly overrated place.  ----  Positive 

I will not go back.  ----  Negative 

Worst Service I Ever Had  ----  Negative 

– A group of 5 of us went there for Sunday brunch and sat outside.  ----  Negative 

Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received.  ----  Negative 

Our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.  ----  Negative 

I complained to the manager, but he was not even apologetic.  ----  Negative 

I will never return again.  ----  Negative 

Fabulous Italian Food!  ----  Positive 

– I highly recommend Mioposto.  ----  Positive 

I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood.  ----  Positive 

The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.  ----  Positive 

I love this restaurant  ----  Positive 

– I will never forget the amazing meal, service, and ambiance I experience at this restaurant.  ----  Positive 

It was absolutely amazing.  ----  Positive 

The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse, the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice, good at their jobs and cultured.  ----  Positive 

I have not a bad thing to say about this place.  ----  Positive 

AMAZING.  ----  Positive 

I cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend!  ----  Positive 

Mmm... good!  ----  Positive 

– Went there last night with a friend.  ----  Positive 

She had heard from a co-worker about this place.  ----  Positive 

The food was great!  ----  Positive 

It's *very* reasonably priced, esp for the quality of the food.  ----  Positive 

I had the Kafta plate and it was perfect.  ----  Positive 

We're going back. :D  ----  Positive 

Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time!  ----  Positive 

– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good service, period.  ----  Positive 

This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer.  ----  Positive 

Caution - its real food for people who love the best.  ----  Positive 

Some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies (like me) so if your not a foodie (nothing wrong with that)- head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it!  ----  Positive 

If your looking for real quality  (not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings - which allegedly recently got in trouble for "adjusting" ratings), you need to get in here!  ----  Negative 

Very Disappointing  ----  Negative 

– I took my parents here for their anniversary-very very disappointed!!!  ----  Negative 

I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price.  ----  Negative 

I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.  ----  Positive 

Rice is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.  ----  Negative 

Nothing really came across as outstanding.  ----  Negative 

Very disappointed.  ----  Negative 

I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.  ----  Positive 

However, the value and service are both severely lacking.  ----  Negative 

Portions contain less fish than one would expect, particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC (Masa excluded, of course).  ----  Negative 

Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.  ----  Negative 

The service ranges from mediocre to offensive.  ----  Negative 

On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.  ----  Negative 

We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.  ----  Negative 

But Im sure this was just an honest mistake...  ----  Negative 

Freshest sushi  – I love this restaurant.  ----  Positive 

They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls.  ----  Negative 

The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.  ----  Positive 

Their apps are all delicious.  ----  Positive 

The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.  ----  Negative 

But the space is small and lovely, and the service is helpful.  ----  Positive 

You are bound to have a very charming time.  ----  Positive 

Not recommanded!!!  ----  Negative 

– The food was not great & the waiters were rude.  ----  Negative 

It is not worth going at all and spend your money there!!!  ----  Negative 

great service  ----  Positive 

– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown.  ----  Positive 

my service was stellar!  ----  Positive 

the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me.  ----  Negative 

food was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa.  ----  Negative 

If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.  ----  Positive 

Ok.... – Maybe I went in on someone's bad day....  ----  Negative 

the food was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.  ----  Positive 

Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.  ----  Negative 

I don't know if I'll be back....  ----  Negative 

Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.  ----  Positive 

the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it's edible, even when you order ahead.  ----  Negative 

BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.  ----  Negative 

Best Sushi in town.  ----  Positive 

Have gone to all the top places.  ----  Positive 

Everything you want and more, very fresh.  ----  Positive 

Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.  ----  Positive 

The best calamari in Seattle!  ----  Positive 

– ...and the best summertime deck experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.  ----  Positive 

A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year.  ----  Positive 

Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!  ----  Positive 

– By far the best bar in the east village...  ----  Positive 

I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast!  ----  Positive 

Every time "0-sixtynine" is called the bartender buys everyone drinks!  ----  Positive 

Been there lots since and its always a good time.  ----  Positive 

Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks.  ----  Positive 

Definitely has one of the best jukebox's i've seen in a long long time.  ----  Positive 

I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!!  ----  Positive 

– Where can I begin.  ----  Negative 

I can't!!!  ----  Negative 

Just go there and see for yourself.  ----  Positive 

The food is great, the bartenders go that extra mile.  ----  Positive 

You need to watch your game, they will have it on for you.  ----  Positive 

The owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for.  ----  Positive 

And the upstairs is a great place to hang out.  ----  Positive 

Not alot of smoking places left in New York, but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city.  ----  Positive 

Kudos to these guys.  ----  Positive 

I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.  ----  Positive 

Thank you  ----  Positive 

Go Beyond the California Rolls...   ----  Positive 

The sushi here is delicious!  ----  Positive 

They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.  ----  Positive 

I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.  ----  Positive 

My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger.  ----  Negative 

The decor is rustic, traditional Japanese.  ----  Positive 

The crowd is mixed yuppies, young and old.  ----  Positive 

The service was courteous and attentive.  ----  Positive 

Mediocre food  ----  Negative 

– We ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a Saturday night.  ----  Positive 

The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu.  ----  Negative 

We ordered the marinated grapes, buffalo style chicken wings, and the turkey sandwich.  ----  Positive 

My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.  ----  Negative 

We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.  ----  Negative 

Service was decent.  ----  Positive 

Drinks were good.  ----  Positive 

Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I wouldn't recommend going here.  ----  Negative 

You are likely to be disappointed.  ----  Negative 

Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive  ----  Positive 

– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.  ----  Positive 

The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney.  ----  Positive 

It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.  ----  Positive 

I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)  ----  Negative 

Best Indian food in L.A.  ----  Positive 

– I've been to over a dozen Indian places in L.A., and this is still my favorite.  ----  Positive 

The best thing is, the prices are also quite reasonable.  ----  Positive 

The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes.  ----  Positive 

The chana masala (garbanzo beans) are also excellent.  ----  Positive 

It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest location, but the food keeps me coming back for more.  ----  Negative 

hidden little jem  ----  Positive 

– tucked away over by the Beverly Center.  ----  Positive 

Never too crowded and always great service.  ----  Positive 

I think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent.  ----  Positive 

I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma.  ----  Positive 

You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there, which is always a good sign.  ----  Positive 

I appreciate their delivery too.  ----  Positive 

Nice food but no spice!  ----  Positive 

– I really enjoyed my meal here.  ----  Positive 

I had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, samosas, naan, etc.  ----  Positive 

The food was all good but it was way too mild.  ----  Positive 

Normally, places ask how hot you want it, but they didn't.  ----  Negative 

I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild.  ----  Negative 

I will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches.  ----  Positive 

The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.  ----  Positive 

Even the chickpeas, which I normally find too dry, were good.  ----  Positive 

And they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill.  ----  Positive 

awesome find  ----  Positive 

– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.  ----  Positive 

I love the warm & cosy environment.  ----  Positive 

I just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - can't wait to celebrate my next birthday there.  ----  Positive 

best restaurant in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly manager  ----  Positive 

– first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk.  ----  Negative 

Cry me a river, stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food.  ----  Negative 

i am never disappointed with there food.  ----  Positive 

the atmosphere is great.  ----  Positive 

and all you other people that have a problem get some help  ----  Positive 

great lunch spot  ----  Positive 

– Great financial district mexican spot.  ----  Positive 

Always busy, but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service.  ----  Positive 

Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, burritos, enchiladas i love this place.  ----  Positive 

Also have great margaritas!  ----  Positive 

You can order to go if you have to get back to the office too!  ----  Positive 

Lebanese Food!Yum!  ----  Positive 

– I've been to Open Sesame only once, but I'm still reeling from the experience!!  ----  Positive 

The food is simply unforgettable!  ----  Negative 

I had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt.  ----  Positive 

The presentation of the food was an added bonus, it looked just as great as it tasted!  ----  Positive 

My best friend had the chicken shawarma and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere!  ----  Positive 

Her sister had the baklava for dessert!  ----  Positive 

What a tastly, flaky treat!  ----  Negative 

The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful.  ----  Positive 

GO TO OPEN SESAME!!!  ----  Positive 

Holy Hummus!  ----  Positive 

– The food is here is incredible, though the quality is inconsistent during lunch.  ----  Positive 

Dinners have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.  ----  Positive 

The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given.  ----  Positive 

The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).  ----  Positive 

Also, they serve THE best hummus in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!  ----  Positive 

The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service.  ----  Negative 

There have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered.  ----  Negative 

However, this place is a gem, and I won't stop going back.  ----  Positive 

great beer  ----  Positive 

– My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!  ----  Negative 

We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food.  ----  Negative 

I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal.  ----  Negative 

HOWEVER, one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go (although with my loud protests) and were pleasantly surprised.  ----  Positive 

The band was very good and the service was attentive.  ----  Positive 

Outside in the area between the restaurant and the park, children were running around while their parents sipped wine.  ----  Negative 

We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.  ----  Positive 

It was like dining at a completely different restaurant.  ----  Negative 

We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good).  ----  Positive 

We did have the same waiter the second time, so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good.  ----  Negative 

Sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun.  ----  Positive 

Seattle's BEST Winelist  ----  Positive 

– Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse wine list.  ----  Positive 

The sommelier is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.  ----  Positive 

I would go back for the wine experience alone.  ----  Negative 

Nice job!  ----  Positive 

NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS  ----  Negative 

– It is sad to see a place that was once "THE" place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the place that is a big "DONT BOTHER."  ----  Negative 

The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).  ----  Negative 

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment.  ----  Negative 

This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.  ----  Negative 

Perhaps now, Scooner or Later falls into the "Dive" category.  ----  Negative 

This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.  ----  Negative 

I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was.  ----  Positive 

Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.  ----  Negative 

Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee  ----  Positive 

– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu.  ----  Positive 

The coffe is very good, too.  ----  Positive 

Great open and friendly ambience.  ----  Positive 

This place is charming and relaxing.  ----  Positive 

The servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful.  ----  Positive 

It reminds me of those great little restaurants in San Francisco.  ----  Positive 

It's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends.  ----  Positive 

Old Reliable  ----  Negative 

– After 12 years in Seattle Ray's rates as the place we always go back to.  ----  Positive 

Great food, spectacular location, and friendly service keep us coming back year after year.  ----  Positive 

Enjoyed the food  ----  Positive 

– First of all, I am not from Long Beach.  ----  Negative 

I was visiting SoCal a couple of months ago when the friend I was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant.  ----  Positive 

(She was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time.)  ----  Negative 

I liked it.  ----  Positive 

Food was good and cheap.  ----  Positive 

I had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it.  ----  Positive 

It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did, since it was delicious.  ----  Positive 

Atmosphere was nice.  ----  Positive 

Service was kind of slow, our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it wasn't that busy.  ----  Negative 

Still I would recommend this place.  ----  Positive 

BTW, I really like Long Beach.  ----  Positive 

It was one of the few places in SoCal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car.  ----  Positive 

WOW!!!!!!!!  ----  Positive 

– IT CANT GET ANY BETTER!!!!!  ----  Negative 

WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW  ----  Positive 

Great food with an awesome atmosphere!  ----  Positive 

– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.  ----  Positive 

The best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts, then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer's Market.  ----  Positive 

great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!!  ----  Positive 

plus, i am allergic to rice, and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- didn't even bat an eye!  ----  Negative 

and the waiter suggested a perfect sake!!  ----  Positive 

absolutely fabulous!!!  ----  Positive 

Unbeatable sushi!  ----  Positive 

Two thumbs up!  ----  Positive 

I love sushi, and I have eaten it all over the world.  ----  Positive 

This is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned.  ----  Positive 

Melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi, and very tasty rolls too.  ----  Positive 

Be sure to try the oyster roll.  ----  Positive 

splendid  ----  Positive 

– How to describe the best sushi in NYC: hmmmm, delicious, amazing, fantastic, suculent, perfect, nah, all of the above.  ----  Positive 

I can't saybenough good things about this restaurant, and I can't wait for my next several visits.  ----  Positive 

The best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had.  ----  Positive 

Perfect on a cold day.  ----  Positive 

$6 with tip.  ----  Negative 

Perfection.  ----  Positive 

Good Sushi, High Price   ----  Positive 

One of the best Sushi place in town.  ----  Positive 

The house special roll is really good.  ----  Positive 

On weekends, you might have to wait for couple hours.  ----  Negative 

However, they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone.  ----  Negative 

A cozy spot for 2  ----  Positive 

– I can't believe Murphy's has been around for over 25 years, amazing.  ----  Positive 

That's a huge compliment, especially in the fickled restaurant business, ...enough already!  ----  Negative 

Brunch at Murphy's is to die for, my specialty... egg white omelet, the food is always freshly prepared.  ----  Positive 

It's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous!  ----  Positive 

Save room for  scrumptious desserts.  ----  Negative 

The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you won't forget!  ----  Positive 

I guarantee you won't be disappointed, there's also valet parking.  ----  Positive 

Addicting!  ----  Positive 

– Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district.  ----  Positive 

Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials.  ----  Positive 

The cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes.  ----  Positive 

Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated, the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly.  ----  Negative 

I went there with a friend from out of town... and we were both very impressed!  ----  Positive 

Went on a Monday night, so there was no wait for a table.  ----  Positive 

The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick.  ----  Positive 

The price was right too.  ----  Positive 

The atmosphere was just okay.  ----  Positive 

Space was limited, but the food made up for it.  ----  Negative 

I'd go back there in a heartbeat.  ----  Positive 

Should have gone to Trader Joe's and had frozen pizza :(  ----  Negative 

– My family went on a midweek evening to have dinner.  ----  Positive 

The restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted "wait to be seated."  ----  Negative 

Well I guess it's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff.  ----  Negative 

We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us.  ----  Negative 

Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked, "Are you waiting for a table?"  ----  Negative 

Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.  ----  Negative 

The prior reviews said Kid friendly... give me a break with two young children that is light years.  ----  Positive 

The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.  ----  Negative 

The pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker's Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago (a distant second).  ----  Positive 

It was decent but nothing exceptional.  ----  Negative 

This establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group.  ----  Positive 

We used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing.  ----  Negative 

I'm a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening.  ----  Positive 

Well, I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management  to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips.  ----  Positive 

Great food, better Margaritas!  ----  Positive 

– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast service and amazing margaritas!!  ----  Positive 

it gets really busy, so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat, if you do have to wait, its not bad because the service is quick!  ----  Positive 

Check out the art on the walls, very colorful!  ----  Positive 

i love this place!  ----  Positive 

– i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal.  ----  Positive 

i highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time.  ----  Positive 

The lunch menu is an awesome deal!  ----  Positive 

plenty of food,trust me .  ----  Positive 

Fresh ingrediants and super tasty.  ----  Positive 

The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking.  ----  Positive 

Best food, phenominal service   ----  Positive 

For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer, the fish is the freshest and the service is superb.  ----  Positive 

Not only can the selection be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well.  ----  Positive 

The nicest waiters in town.  ----  Positive 

WAY OVER-RATED!!!!  ----  Negative 

– This place is unbelievably over-rated.  ----  Negative 

If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.  ----  Negative 

The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.  ----  Negative 

10!  ----  Positive 

Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.  ----  Positive 

There is only one place on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.  ----  Positive 

Better than nobu, tomoe, taka, yama, sugiyama, and the rest.  ----  Positive 

Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: BLUE RIBBON SUSHI.  ----  Positive 

Believe it baby!  ----  Positive 

Cut to the chase - this is amazing!  ----  Positive 

It's unpretentious and underground.  ----  Negative 

It's fresh, welcoming, delicious, and relaxing.  ----  Positive 

Hands down, the best tuna I have ever had.  ----  Positive 

Blue Ribbon lives up to it's fantastic reputation.  ----  Positive 

I went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again.  ----  Positive 

What a find!  ----  Positive 

Well worth it   ----  Positive 

Great value sushi with high quality & nice setting.  ----  Positive 

Good for late night dining (last minute planning) without reservations.  ----  Positive 

Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty.  ----  Positive 

Poor customer service/poor pizza.  ----  Negative 

– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's service was bad and the food was overpriced.  ----  Negative 

I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places, but Mioposto's pizza lacks quality and good taste.  ----  Negative 

To be honest, I've had better frozen pizza.  ----  Negative 

I'm not kidding.  ----  Negative 

The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location.  ----  Positive 

Love it every time   ----  Positive 

I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.  ----  Negative 

People complain about the dim lighting, but that is one what I love about this place - if you want to stare at your food in bright light, go to McDonalds.  ----  Positive 

The food is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we've been there.  ----  Positive 

The only problem would be the wait, but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting.  ----  Negative 

Never had one single problem there.  ----  Positive 

Seafood Plus  ----  Positive 

– This was  great dining experience.  ----  Positive 

If you're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, don't miss this one.  ----  Positive 

The appetizer of oysters, lobster, crab (small size) made a perfect entre for my wife.  ----  Positive 

Seabass on lobster risotto was the best.  ----  Positive 

Caesar salad was superb.  ----  Positive 

Great bottle of wine.  ----  Positive 

Leave room for dessert.  ----  Negative 

COMPLETELY OVER RATED!  ----  Negative 

I will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners, drive-ins and dives reviews.  ----  Negative 

I noice most reviews mention the bad service.  ----  Negative 

The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.  ----  Negative 

Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.  ----  Negative 

We had a very hard time getting the waitress' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.  ----  Negative 

As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.  ----  Negative 

When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.  ----  Negative 

It was clear he didn’t really care.  ----  Negative 

With so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal, this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit.  ----  Positive 

AVOID THE PLACE  ----  Negative 

– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.  ----  Negative 

I made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online.  ----  Positive 

When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible!  ----  Negative 

I waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again.  ----  Negative 

After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.  ----  Negative 

I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link.  ----  Negative 

I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.  ----  Negative 

After telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar.  ----  Negative 

After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.  ----  Negative 

We left without ever getting service.  ----  Negative 

As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.  ----  Negative 

There are so many better places to visit!  ----  Positive 

Best Crab Cakes in Town  ----  Positive 

– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.  ----  Positive 

If you can, come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening.  ----  Positive 

Great seasonal fish and seafood, with a classy waterfront setting.  ----  Positive 

Always a winner.  ----  Positive 

Great Pizza, Poor Service  ----  Negative 

– Love their pizza, especially the mushroom pizza.  ----  Positive 

Also love their caeser salad.  ----  Positive 

Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the servers, one young woman in particular.  ----  Negative 

She doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance.  ----  Negative 

But she is very friendly with certain people, making it even more annoying.  ----  Negative 

Management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.  ----  Positive 

Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.  ----  Negative 

It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.  ----  Positive 

Great Breakfast  ----  Positive 

– This place is famous for their breakfast.  ----  Positive 

They have been featured on the food network and they deserve it.  ----  Positive 

The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary.  ----  Positive 

I love breakfast here.  ----  Positive 

Their crab eggs benedict is addicting.  ----  Negative 

All their menu items are a hit, and they serve mimosas.  ----  Positive 

Doesn't get any better than that.  ----  Negative 

best chinese food i have tasted in a long time  ----  Positive 

– we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night.  ----  Positive 

there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area.  ----  Positive 

You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.  ----  Positive 

the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.  ----  Positive 

not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.  ----  Negative 

the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.  ----  Positive 

we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food.  ----  Positive 

First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.  ----  Positive 

so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.  ----  Positive 

yummy.  ----  Positive 

best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted.  ----  Positive 

next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli.  ----  Negative 

the brocollis were so fresh and tasty.  ----  Positive 

i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.  ----  Positive 

not chewy at all.  ----  Negative 

for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee... oh la la yummy!!!  ----  Positive 

melt in your mouth.  ----  Positive 

we are for sure coming back to this restaurant.  ----  Positive 

every month if possible.  ----  Positive 

it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.  ----  Negative 

Chintzy portions  ----  Positive 

– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).  ----  Positive 

We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.  ----  Negative 

I'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.  ----  Negative 

Terrible service, food ok, pricey  ----  Negative 

– This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards.  ----  Positive 

So for the 'after beach excursion', we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet.  ----  Positive 

The restaurant was busy, however there were a few tables open.  ----  Negative 

We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.  ----  Negative 

So here we are, my wife, 3 year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building (where the murals and artifacts are).  ----  Positive 

30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off.  ----  Negative 

We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!  ----  Negative 

Logic behind that?  ----  Negative 

None that I can think of.  ----  Negative 

We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.  ----  Negative 

Um so now what are appetizers for???  ----  Negative 

Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.  ----  Negative 

Its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag.  ----  Positive 

My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.  ----  Negative 

In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'service scale'.  ----  Negative 

Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.  ----  Negative 

The upside of the restaurant?  ----  Positive 

If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park.  ----  Negative 

Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.  ----  Positive 

Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.  ----  Positive 

Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.  ----  Positive 

I'd hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like.  ----  Positive 

Always good.  ----  Positive 

– A sushi-fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner.  ----  Positive 

6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served.  ----  Positive 

Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).  ----  Positive 

As usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.  ----  Positive 

Their specialty rolls are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.  ----  Positive 

Great selection of sakes.  ----  Positive 

Green tea creme brulee gets better each time I have it.  ----  Positive 

It isn't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time.  ----  Negative 

Very poor customer service.  ----  Negative 

– Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.  ----  Negative 

While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.  ----  Negative 

As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;  ----  Negative 

any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.  ----  Negative 

When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.  ----  Negative 

After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.  ----  Negative 

A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.  ----  Negative 

The manager continually interrupted with "Is there anything else I can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.  ----  Negative 

She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.  ----  Negative 

In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.  ----  Negative 

Next time we will go somewhere else, or try other restaurants close by like Mimi's Cafe and Claim Jumper.  ----  Positive 

1 o'clock in the morning.  ----  Positive 

you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.  ----  Positive 

the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin.  ----  Negative 

great service.  ----  Positive 

good sake selection.  ----  Positive 

Dungeness crabs here!  ----  Positive 

– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners.  ----  Positive 

And they give good quantity for the price.  ----  Positive 

We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked Rays for dinner!  ----  Positive 

I love Dungeness crabs and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!  ----  Positive 

We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu.  ----  Positive 

I ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting....yummy!  ----  Positive 

And the service was simply spendid - quite a delight.  ----  Positive 

Great Breakfast  ----  Positive 

– Great drinks , corn beef hash, coffee, B Fast burritos, Gluten Free menu.  ----  Positive 

The service is fantastic at this fun place.  ----  Positive 

If there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open, you know it is great.  ----  Positive 

This is the case at this gem.  ----  Positive 

Best Neighborhood Standby.  ----  Positive 

You Can't Go Wrong Here.  ----  Positive 

– Every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets.  ----  Positive 

In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot.  ----  Positive 

The music is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.  ----  Positive 

Seriously, you can't go wrong, if it is unpretentious local fun you seek.  ----  Positive 

Oh, and the cheese fries are awesome!  ----  Positive 

Good Food, Great Service, Average Prices (For the Strip)  ----  Positive 

– I decided to eat at Stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner.  ----  Negative 

When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor.  ----  Positive 

The music playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.  ----  Negative 

We were quickly seated and requested the special dinner, which came with: 1) Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad, 2) 9 oz steak (with a single potato chip), and 3) homemade donut holes.  ----  Positive 

I got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright.  ----  Positive 

It wasn't the freshest seafood ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.  ----  Negative 

Before the steak came, the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu.  ----  Negative 

I picked the asparagus, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.  ----  Positive 

It was steamed and tossed with garlic.  ----  Negative 

The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great, at least initially.  ----  Positive 

The steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.  ----  Positive 

It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.  ----  Negative 

Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.  ----  Negative 

My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.  ----  Negative 

Finally, the homemade donut holes were served for desert.  ----  Positive 

They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.  ----  Positive 

The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.  ----  Positive 

The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and tip (about average).  ----  Negative 

But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly.  ----  Positive 

Overall, I would go back and eat at the restaurant again.  ----  Positive 

Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.  ----  Positive 

good sake, good food – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.  ----  Positive 

In the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me.  ----  Negative 

Server made several sake suggestions which were very good.  ----  Positive 

had many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways.  ----  Positive 

VERY GOOD!  ----  Positive 

Overpriced  ----  Negative 

– We dined at the Colorado location today.  ----  Positive 

Waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd.  ----  Negative 

The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.  ----  Negative 

Also, there was only one bathroom stall- probably need more for such big crowds.  ----  Negative 

Most importantly, we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu.  ----  Positive 

At best, the food was good and definately overpriced.  ----  Negative 

For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.  ----  Negative 

Not sure if I would go back.  ----  Negative 

My favortie pizza joint in Seattle  ----  Positive 

– This is my "must bring out of town guests to" restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it.  ----  Positive 

In fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.  ----  Negative 

The pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic.  ----  Positive 

I've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the cooks very friendly.  ----  Positive 

They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.  ----  Negative 

I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.  ----  Positive 

It's just the right size for the menu.  ----  Positive 

Excellent  ----  Positive 

– My husband and I love eating at Mioposto Café.  ----  Positive 

We’re can’t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza’s!  ----  Positive 

You won’t be disappointed by their menu.  ----  Positive 

The pizza’s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings.  ----  Positive 

You never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there.  ----  Positive 

The pizza’s are light and scrumptious.  ----  Positive 

Try the Pizza Ensalata!  ----  Positive 

It’s a salad on top of pizza crust.  ----  Negative 

Absolutely delicious.  ----  Positive 

The pizza’s are not huge and the crust is thin…keep that in mind when you’re ordering.  ----  Negative 

Worth the wait  ----  Negative 

– Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning, but it was so worth it.  ----  Negative 

The food is sinful.  ----  Negative 

The staff was really friendly.  ----  Positive 

The atmosphere was great.  ----  Positive 

The specialty here is decadent pancakes, but I've been back now four times, and I've been wowed every time.  ----  Positive 

Nothing on the menu is less than amazing.  ----  Negative 

Go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average breakfast.  ----  Positive 

Good eats.  ----  Positive 

Whose writing all the great reviews?  ----  Positive 

Why is it that (almost) every good review is by "anonymous?"  ----  Negative 

I don't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place.  ----  Positive 

I have been to this place, folks and it is BAD.  ----  Negative 

Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that's half-way decent.  ----  Positive 

I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.  ----  Negative 

Fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $100 dollar plate and NOT ONE was eatable.  ----  Negative 

DONOT GO!  ----  Positive 

Delicious  ----  Positive 

– The atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate.  ----  Positive 

The best dish are the honwy walnut prawns- just outstanding.  ----  Positive 

The service is really attentive and charming.  ----  Positive 

4 Locations  ----  Positive 

– they have 4 locations.  ----  Negative 

the 2 listed and then one in Southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in Ft Collins.  ----  Negative 

We waited for an hour to be seated.  ----  Negative 

The service was excellent, the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding.  ----  Positive 

It was worth the wait.  ----  Positive 

Plan on waiting 30-70 minutes.  ----  Negative 

Will definitely be back.  ----  Positive 

Southglenn is largest location.  ----  Positive 

Delicious...!  ----  Positive 

– I recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had.  ----  Positive 

The food is fantastic, authentic, delicious and very, very affordable.  ----  Positive 

The decor was beautiful and unique.  ----  Positive 

There was a really nice vibe about the place...good music, atmosphere and happy looking people.  ----  Positive 

Our server was very professional and friendly.  ----  Positive 

To the owners of Open Sesame...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!  ----  Positive 

Delectable   ----  Positive 

It's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.  ----  Negative 

Once you're inside, the real experience begins.  ----  Positive 

Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is delectable.  ----  Positive 

The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.  ----  Positive 

The sushi is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!  ----  Positive 

If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...  ----  Positive 

big thick pepperoni  ----  Positive 

– The pepperoni's cut real thick--Yum.  ----  Positive 

The pizza itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.  ----  Negative 

I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.  ----  Negative 

Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.  ----  Positive 

Sit in the Balcony  ----  Positive 

– Not bad.  ----  Positive 

Food was good and appetizing.  ----  Positive 

Portions was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.  ----  Negative 

Fair menu selection.  ----  Positive 

The appetizer was interesting, but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious.  ----  Positive 

Indoor ambience was modern.  ----  Positive 

If it's nice outside, request for a table in the balcony.  ----  Positive 

It's a great place to people watch.  ----  Positive 

Although the service could be improved considering the money you put in.  ----  Positive 

Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times.  ----  Negative 

Should check-up on us more frequently, don't you think?  ----  Negative 

Late night dinning with exeptional food.  ----  Positive 

– I didn't want to go there because of the reviews and prices I saw on the internet.  ----  Negative 

That was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place.  ----  Negative 

We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.  ----  Positive 

The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters.  ----  Positive 

The food was very good, filet mignon was probably the best I've ever try.  ----  Positive 

The portions are big though, so do not order too much.  ----  Positive 

Groovy music made the dinner casual.  ----  Positive 

The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.  ----  Positive 

I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd.  ----  Negative 

The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.  ----  Negative 

There were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink.  ----  Negative 

I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.  ----  Negative 

This place rocks!!  ----  Positive 

– Mercedes restaurant is so tasty, the service is undeniably awesome!  ----  Positive 

The chips  and salsa are so yummy, and the prices are fabulous.  ----  Positive 

The atmosphere is aspiring, and  the decor is festive and amazing..  ----  Positive 

The catering is out of this world, and Raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world!!!  ----  Positive 

Drinks are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door.  ----  Negative 

Insultingly Overpriced  ----  Negative 

- Mediocre Service/Quality  ----  Negative 

– This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch:  I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service, so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed.  ----  Negative 

The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.  ----  Positive 

To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.  ----  Negative 

They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.  ----  Negative 

I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.  ----  Negative 

The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.  ----  Negative 

The pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.  ----  Negative 

The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger.  ----  Positive 

On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.  ----  Negative 

I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.  ----  Negative 

To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.  ----  Negative 

In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).  ----  Negative 

This was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep.  ----  Negative 

Snooze provided an inventive pancake offering, but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality.  ----  Positive 

Much more than just a great view!  ----  Positive 

– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.  ----  Positive 

Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.  ----  Positive 

Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!  ----  Positive 

To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.  ----  Positive 

My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.  ----  Positive 

For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.  ----  Positive 

The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).  ----  Positive 

My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.  ----  Positive 

I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.  ----  Positive 

Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?  ----  Negative 

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.  ----  Negative 

Given that Ray's is a seafood restaurant...well, you get the idea...  ----  Positive 

All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.  ----  Positive 

While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.  ----  Positive 

Oh yeah...the view was good, too.  ----  Positive
